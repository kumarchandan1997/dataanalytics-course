1)In python every thing is object
2)type(a) => return data type
3)python support a=10 and next line a="chandan" also allow it not return error
4)string.find('chandan') => if present than return 0 other wise 1 and this function case sensitive
5)replace() => str.replace('chandan','yadav',1)  => 1 means count how many place you want to replace
6)str.split()  => string to array
7)t='dog';
  f'chandan like {t}  => return like this 'chandan like dog'


######
List ordered data structure
#####
1)array is list in python example => numbers = [1,2,3]   and newArray = [1111,2,fruits];  print(newArray);
2)list are mutiable means can change value inside list
3)append => add one value in list in last numbers.append(100);
4)extend => it also return array and indivisual value of array also
5)remove => array.remove(200) than it remove that value from array single value remove and not return any thing
6)pop => array.pop() => remove last element of array and return delete element and you can also pass index than it remove that index value and if not pass than remove from last
7)insert() => array.insert(1,200) => index and value on that place data insert
8)in => 9 in list => check data present or not  print(9,array);
9)extend => array.extend(['radha','rani']) => it include array data in last of array seprate value
10)len(array) => return length of string

#####
dictionary unorder data structure
#####
1)

#####
Tuples
#####
1)it can store multiple items in a single varible.
2)they are ordered
3)they allow dublicate value
4)immutable
5)example => (1,2,[1,2,3],{'a':12321});
6)Tuples.count(4) => it return 4 present in Tuples
7)tuple.index(2) => it return index of that value first occurance


#####
Sets
#####
1)sets are mutiable sequence of multiple elements stored in a single varible,enclosed in curly braces
2)it is un-ordered
3)it not allow dublicate value
4)we can not slice and index sets
5)create empty set like this set = set();
6)set.add(4);  => it add one value in set
7)x.intersection(y) => return common element in set
